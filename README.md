processor_race
==============

This idea came from reading "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" 
by Richard Stevens for my System's Programming class. The book demos a fun
race condition racing game. I thought it would be fun to implement it in Go 
and then possibly give it a GUI frontend.

This repository holds my interpretation of the program using Go channels.
